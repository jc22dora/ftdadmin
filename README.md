# ftdadmin
ftdadmin is a package of modules I use on my local machine to control, audit, modify and maintain the ftdpack. This package should not be used and is more of a 'show and tell'. 


# Future

There are a lot of inefficiencies, undone work, and system design flaws in this current iteration. There are a lot of methods that were used in a previous version that are no longer used(noted as "Not used"). I left them in because they might be used in the future. Most of these methods are not unit tested due to the fact that a lot of them are clunky and need refactoring. Refactoring and unittesting are my biggest priorities going forward.
